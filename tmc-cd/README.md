This directory contains resources needed to create the cluster specific App object for the cluster.  Each cluster provisioned or attached in TMC has a name, and these resources use this name to define an App that references the folder under the "clusters" path of this repo that has the same name as the name of the cluster as assigned in TMC.

The way this config works is that we use a SecretTemplate object (managed by secretgen-controller) to extract the name that this cluster is registered under from a ConfigMap called "stack-config" in the "vmware-tmc-system" namespace.  The extracted data gets stored in a secret that is then used in the "tmc-cd-bootstrap" App object (managed by kapp-controller) to create _another_ App object that specifically refers to the subdirectory under the "clusters" directory that cooreseponds to the name of the cluster we're managing in TMC.
