# Demo Clusters
This repo is used to configure clusters via TMC's Continuous Delivery feature.  All clusters in a cluster group can be made to point to this repo, and then pick up specific configurations.

This work is heavily inspired by https://github.com/warroyo/infra-gitops and https://github.com/jeffellin/tmc-experiments.
