This directory contains subdirectories for each package.  Those directories contain a Package info object (metadata.yaml) for each package, as well as the version specific PackageMetadata files for that package.  Think of these packages as the "roles" for your clusters.

You might only need to define one PackageMetadata for each package if you don't need to maintain multiple versions of your packages.
